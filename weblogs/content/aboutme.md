#  whoami

Hey!

I'm a machine learning software engineer [@BoschSensortec](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/) focusing on Edge-AI deployment strategies.

Currently, my area of interests are to build software tools to bring meaningful appliances of artificial intelligence at the edge; specifically, on low power embedded devices 

Prior to Embedded-AI, I have worked in the Automotive industry on vehicle networking protocols, in the banking services for verification systems and in the space research organization to implement control systems on embedded platforms.

Apart from work, I like hiking, mountain biking and traveling. Occasionally, I do photography and regularly I cook. Sometimes, I just put my  headphones on while coding - listening to all genres of music 󱚓

Feel free to explore the content and reach out if you'd like to connect.
