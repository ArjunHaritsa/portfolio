## Why blogging?

Clearly this is an era of AI that we are witnessing with LLMs; simulating & mocking human intelligence as agents - text translation, text interpretation and text transformation is nearly a solved problem by today for an average Joe. Stack overflow is hitting all time low in their listings for any technical assistance post while LLMs are conjugating as senators - from code explanations to code reviews. Their performance is a topic for another day but in this era of "Ask Chat-GPT to create a concrete plan for 3 days road trip in Switzerland", who has overcome their ADHD to read a blog post?

Well, I don't intend to address the blog to anyone to be honest, it's a note keeper for me; a salient friend who wires up some neurons in my brain to organize my thoughts into the tips of my fingers or to avail of the Feynman technique or to develop a mental clarity about a concept that I'm trying to understand and to avoid brain rot from the information overflow, scrolling over the social media postings.

## What's on my mind?

At times, I will write technical contents of `Math` behind `Deep Learning`, `C++` and software frameworks. I'm an advocate of philosophy - `Vedanta` has impeccable sources of wisdom to ponder and large verses to explain. I will try to pen down contextual translations of the verses to "the generation of science" in a comprehensible manner; and in ಕನ್ನಡ, some of my poems and short stories will be posted.

## Who ought to be the listeners?

The universe and serendipity. One who pops for a reference, one who wants to discuss further on a post and for the ones that want to fix the mistakes in my typos or equations.
