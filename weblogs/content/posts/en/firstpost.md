## Why blogging?

Clearly, this is an era of AI that we are witnessing. With LLMs simulating & mocking human intelligence, conventional world is merely depicting a portal to a dystopian era. Agents are solving - text translation, text interpretation and text transformation in seconds that were once considered unsolvable by humans due to the heterogeneity in the language space. But today, for an average Joe, building UI rich websites (vibe coding), performing data analysis on their spending & investments (Gemini) are been tailored to executable scripts in seconds by commencing a computer with natural languages!

Stack overflow is hitting all time low in their listings for any technical assistance post while LLMs are conjugating as senators - from code explanations to code reviews.

Their performance is a topic for another day but in this era of "Ask Chat-GPT to create a concrete plan for 3 days road trip in Switzerland", who has overcome their ADHD to read a blog post?

Well, I don't intend to address the blog to anyone to be honest, it's a note keeper for me; a salient friend who wires up a few neurons to organize some of my thoughts and pen them down here or to experiment with Feynman's technique for a concept that I'm trying to understand or to avoid brain rot from information overflow, scrolling over the social media postings; I will be writing or we may all have to - at some point in the future we won't need to be coding anyways!

## What's on my mind?

At times, I will write technical contents - `Math` behind `Deep Learning` architectures, intrinsics of `C++` and exemplary usages of certain software frameworks for developers. I'm an advocate of philosophy - `Vedanta` has impeccable sources of wisdom to ponder and large verses to explain; I will try to carefully decipher the contextual translations of the verses in a comprehensible manner; and in ಕನ್ನಡ, some of my poems and short stories will be constantly posted.

## Who ought to be the listeners?

The universe and serendipity. One who pops up for a reference, one who wants to discuss further on a post and for those of you who wants to fix typos or equations in my articles - all are welcome to visit this site!
